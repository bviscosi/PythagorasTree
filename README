Your name: BENJAMIN VISCOSI

Hours to complete assignment: 10

/**********************************************************************
 *  Briefly discuss the assignment itself and what you accomplished.
 **********************************************************************/
This was a challenging assignment that took a lot of brainstorming/pseudocoding before any  implementation took place.
However, I enjoyed it very much as it made me rack my brain for solutions to problems I hadn't even thought about before starting the project.

 /**********************************************************************
 *  Discuss one or more key algorithms, data structures, or 
 *  OO designs that were central to the assignment.
 **********************************************************************/
I originally used linked nodes for my tree, but  I later decided that they would not be neccessary so long as I did not clear the render window until the end of the drawing process.


 /**********************************************************************
 *  Briefly explain what you learned in the assignment.
 **********************************************************************/
I learned that while recursion can make our lives easier at times, the amiguity that comes along with it
can present its own road blocks along the way.


/**********************************************************************
 *  List whatever help (if any) you received from the instructor,
 *  classmates, or anyone else.

/**********************************************************************
 *  Describe any serious problems you encountered.  
 *  If you didn't complete any part of any assignment, 
 *  the things that you didn't do, or didn't get working.                  
 **********************************************************************/
Getting any angle to work was a challenge, 
and once I got it working getting the tree to center perfectly in the 
window was another challenge that unfortunately I was not able to solve.
